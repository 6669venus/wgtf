Welcome to the developer documentation for Next Gen Tools!

\section NGT Vision

With the New Tools Framework we plan to create a generic platform for the development of tools across multiple studios that can be easily shared, modified and extended.
While game studios share many common requirements, each project has its own unique requirements. For this reason, the tools framework will be customisable via plugins. Plugins may implement game-specific features, for example Tank Physics, or general purpose features such as Sound Editing. Plugins can be shared easily by publishing them to an asset repository. Frequently used plugins may become officially supported.
Tools releases will be decoupled from BigWorld core releases to promote rapid development of tools features. Features will be owned by the studios that were initially responsible for their development.

The existing MFC-based tool suite will be replaced with a new QT/QML tool suite that will encourage rapid UI development and give power to UI designers and artists to shape the look and feel of our tools.
